This is a python program that will create homebrew recipes from simple
parameters such as target gravity, grain bill by percent, hops and
yeast.  It calculates IBUs, Grain amounts, yeast amounts and water
volumes. It can produce three types of reports, text, html and
pdf. Here are two example reports:

   - http://www.jeremyenglish.org/docs/Moose-Drool.pdf
   - http://www.jeremyenglish.org/docs/Golden-Slumbers-Bitter.html

The program uses reportlab to generate the pdf.

To see how the program works check the file myRecipes.py. Hopefully, it is
self explanitory if not send me an email at jhe@jeremyenglish.org

I probably will not be working on this program anymore.  If someone
would like to take the code and run with it please do.  If you do
decide to work on it please give it a better name ;)
